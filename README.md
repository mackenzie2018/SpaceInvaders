# Space Invaders

Started off as a follow-along code from Tech with Tim's Space Invaders video, for which the code was not mine. The original goal was just to get more comfortable with certain programming concepts, particularly classes and inheritance.

It's since changed and grown quite a bit from TechWithTim's original video. Namely:

- I changed the structure of the code a fair bit, storing the "state" of the various game objects in a dict. This appealed to my sensibilities more, but does have the benefit of being easily extendible to incorporate other, new objects into the game. Such as....
- Health packs. Collide with the health packs to gain health. If already at max health it works like an overshield. Max 3 health packs in the game at any one time.
- I added a score and sound effects, also written and produced by myself in Studio One Professional. A good way to incorporate my more creative hobbies :)
